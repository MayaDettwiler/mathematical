#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = "maya" + "dettwiler"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = 4 + 4
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
z = 10 - 5
print(z)


#4) Make two float variables  and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = 2.5 - 1.5
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
b = 5 * 5
print(b)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
c = "yes" * 7
print(c)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
d = 6 / 3
print(d)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e = 6.5 / 2.5 
print(e)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
f = 5 % 4
print(f)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
g = 2 // 2
print(g)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h = 4 ** 4 
print(h)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
l = 3 + 3 
prit(l)
